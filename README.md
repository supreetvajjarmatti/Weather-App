To create your own weather app project using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
2. Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
3. Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
4. Create a script.js file. The file name must be script and its extension .js


Please note that your weather app is currently unable to retrieve weather details because you have not provided your API key in the AP_KEY variable. To get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap, sign up for an account at https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.
